The file system differs from Windows, but is similar to the Mac OS. I will take you by the hand and show you step by step everything you have to know.\r\n\r\n## Open the Bash\r\nThe ```BASH``` or also known as ```TERMINAL``` is the place to be. The terminal unites your desktop, file manager, text editor and many more. Furthermore you can install or uninstall programs, configure your system, start webservers and so one. Hopefully you have recognized the fundamental super power of the secret black box calles terminal\r\n\r\n*If you using a Raspbian Desktop, click on the black screen icon in the upper panel bar called **LXTerminal**.*\r\n\r\n## First view\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npi@raspberrypi ~ $\r\n```\r\n\r\n- ```pi``` stands for the logged in user.\r\n- ```raspberrypi``` stands for the computer or rather the device you are using.\r\n- ```~``` stands for your home folder. In Windows it is \"My Documents\" or in German \"Eigene Dateien\"\r\n\r\n## ```cd``` Change the directory\r\nDirectories are your folders like \"Downloads\", \"Desktop\" etc. Every system has a root directory. The beginning of every path starts in there and is callable by ```/```.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npi@raspberrypi ~ $ cd /\r\n```\r\nChange directory to / -> Bring me to the root directory\r\n\r\nAnd you can see, that the beginning of your command line changed to something similiar like ```pi@raspberrypi / $```. The only difference is that ```~``` changed to ```/```.\r\n\r\n## ```ls``` List content of the current directory\r\nYou have seen that your command line is something like a magnifiying glass on a specific folder or rather directory. Every command you will type in the terminal will have its starting point from there. If you have follwed the previous parts you are currently in the root directory ```/```.\r\n\r\nNow type in just the these two single letters: ```ls```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npi@raspberrypi / $ ls\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output should be exactly like here: \r\n```bash\r\nbin  boot  dev  etc  home  lib  lost+found  media  mnt  opt  proc  root  run  sbin  selinux  srv  sys  tmp  usr  var\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese terms are mostly directories. ```ls``` lists all directories and files included in the current path you are.\r\n\r\n\r\n**TO BE CONTINUED**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
